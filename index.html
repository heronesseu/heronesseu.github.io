                    <h3>Welcome to my page!</h3>
                    <p class="paragraphs">
                        I am <b>Hero</b> and this is my attempt in building a website. I am 26-years-old by the time I create this website. I am living in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan but I spent most of my life in the progressive city in Metro Manila - Quezon City. My undergraduate degree is Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics, and I graduated in 2020.

                    <p class="paragraphs">
                        I have been working for almost 5 years now, but I still consider myself a newbie in adulthood. I am the youngest child, but I have 11 nieces and nephews. Instead of having a bubbly youngest child attitude, I mostly have a caring and <i>mapang-asar tita</i> vibe. I don't know what to say anymore so I'll cut it here for now. I hope you enjoy visiting my page!

                        <h3>Watching Everything</h3>
                        <p class="paragraphs">There's something magical about watching movies, series, animes, or YouTube videos. It is my go-to leisure when I have free time. It usually comes in cycle because I get bored easily. There are some phases where I bingewatch Disney movies for weeks. Other times I crave nature or science documentaries. I also watch animes and series (Kdrama, Jdrama, American, etc) but it consumes all of my attention so I don't do it often. I find watching YouTube videos convenient. However, this convenience leads to doomscrolling and immense guilt afterwards.</p>
                        <p>Anyway, let's watch a video from my favorite YouTube channel - Smosh Games!</p>

                        <h3>Playing games</h3>
                        <p class="paragraphs">I am not an avid gamer, and I usually lose interest quickly, so I never have invested much time enhancing my skill in playing games. I treat playing games as a way to connect to my friends though, so I can say I play a lot of games. It can vary from time-to-time. We play coop mobile and computer games. But when I am not with my friends, I just play some mobile cozy games.</p>

                        <h3>Driving!</h3>
                        <p class="paragraphs">The Philippines will not give everyone the best experience in driving. Uneven roads, heavy traffic, limited parking spaces, and high prices of gasoline are just some of the reasons why driving is not enjoyable in the country. I am often told that my love of driving will fade out once I experience being a driver for a long time. I learned how to drive in 2021, and I still love driving up to this day.</p>
                        <p class="paragraphs">I also wondered why that is. It is not that I love being stuck in the traffic. I also hate that gasoline prices are sky-high. I hate driving, especially when I have to look for parking. And I find the uneven roads annoying too. But why do I still love driving? Upon pondering, it is not the convenience that I like about it. I actually prefer commuting than finding parking spaces. What I like about it is the peace that it gives me. Long trips or short, I like how my mind quiets down as soon as I hold the steering wheel. Since I have to be present at all times, I have no choice but to focus on driving. As a person who is always anxious, it feels like a vacation or an espace from my thoughts. </p>
